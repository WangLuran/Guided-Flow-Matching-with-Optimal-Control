## Introduction
We introduce *OC-Flow* as a general and theoretically grounded framework for guided flow matching. By formulating gradient guidance within the optimal control framework, we present the first training-free approach with proven convergence in both Euclidean and SO(3) spaces. OC-Flow demonstrates superior performance in extensive experiments on text-guided image manipulation, conditional molecule generation, and peptide backbone design.
