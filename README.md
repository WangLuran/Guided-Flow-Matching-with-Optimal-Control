## Introduction
We introduce *OC-Flow* as a general and theoretically grounded framework for guided flow matching. By formulating the task of gradient guidance into the framework of optimal control, we provide the first training-free framework for guided flow matching with proven convergence in both Euclidean and SO(3) spaces. OC-Flow achieved superior performance in extensive experiments on text-guided image manipulation, conditional molecule generation, and peptide backbone design. Check out our paper for more details!
