## Introduction

We introduce *statistical flow matching* (SFM) as a novel discrete generative framework on the manifold of parameterized probability measures inspired by information geometry. Using the Fisher-Rao metric, we obtain the intrinsic Riemannian geometry of the statistical manifold and propose a numerically stable FM algorithm on categorical data with a diffeomorphism. SFM enjoys multiple advantages thanks to its continuous and geometric formulation. Check out our paper for more details!
