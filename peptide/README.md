# OC-Flow for Peptide Design

## Overview
This repository contains code for peptide design using \textbf{OC-Flow}, based on the paper: 
*Full-Atom Peptide Design based on Multi-modal Flow Matching (ICML 2024)*.

To reproduce the experiments in the paper, run the following command:

```
sbatch peptide/submit_rlhf_fm.py
```

## Data and Pretrained Model Weights

The data and pretrained model weights used for peptide design tasks are provided in [PepFlow](https://github.com/Ced3-han/PepFlowww)


Stay tuned for updates and feel free to reach out for collaboration or discussions!
